# ABOUT
You are a Wizard who must rid the realm of evil Warlcks. Navigate levels, using your magic to destroy warlcks as you encounter them.

But there's a catch: these Warlcks have enchanted their domains so that all magical elements except one are forbidden. You can only use the magic element that corresponds to the robe you are wearing. 

As you complete each level, you are rewarded with more advanced robes to defeat the stronger Warlcks.
